A bundle of my personal configuration files, scripts and such.

Feel absolutely free to use them in any manner you want to.

However, they are provided 'as-is', thus any possible unexpected
featureful behaviour that might occur are fully dis-, un-, de- and
'a pile of other negating prefixes'-claimed. You are responsible
for your own system after all.

If you require a tad more formal 'license', take a look at
http://unlicense.org/ and despair, for that is the one I embrace,
unless otherwise noted.

See the licenses of the respective software that these configuration
files are concerned with, for they are fully applicable and to be
respected, in the event of you caring at all about common decency.
