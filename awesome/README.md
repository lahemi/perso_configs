After several months of agony and turmoil, I return back to Awesome.
I quite learned to love the arbitrary tiling in i3, the funkiness
of Guile-wm, was positively suprised by Wingo and so forth.
I'm also more capable with Lua than I used to be. Much more capable.
And so Awesome beckoned. Despite Awesome's horrid tiling and certain
other little quirks, I just plain enjoy far too much hacking and
scripting my wm - and Awesome is the for Lua, currently at least.


The keybindings can be found modekeys.lua, including the clientkeys.
Three different input modes are defined, alongside the main one, there
are two subset modes, one for clients and one for running programs.

Avescripts are my new "modules", scripts for keybindings, widgets, whatnot.
Much more to follow..

Aveinit, boxen and tboxbase take care of blue-taccing my scripts to
Awesome. They are quite simple, yet they cost me partly one nights sleep.

My scripts are GPLv3 licensed.
