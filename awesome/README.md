These are, probably already outdated, configs for awesome wm I use.

The keybindings are set in rckeys.lua, in order to make it easier
for others to reuse my configs by modularity.

You also need to change the parametres for the network widget,
unless you're using systemd on your machine and happen to have
enp2s0 too...

There is also a directory 'teatime' which contains my horrid un-Lua-tastic
widgets for OSS volume, and much more importantly, a hexadecimal and
Unix time clocks.

You are fully entitled and free to modify, redistribute and
in any way in general to elaborate on my configuration files.

See the respective licenses of Awesome WM and Vicious.
