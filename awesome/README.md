These are, probably already outdated, configs for awesome wm I use.

The keybindings can be found modekeys.lua, including the clientkeys.
Three different input modes are defined, alongside the main one, there
are two subset modes, one for clients and one for running programs.

You also need to change the parametres for the network widget, unless
you're using systemd on your machine and happen to have enp2s0 too...

There is also a directory 'teatime' which contains my horrid un-Lua-tastic
widgets for OSS volume, and much more importantly, a hexadecimal and
Unix time clocks.

You are fully entitled and free to modify, redistribute and in any way
in general to elaborate on my configuration files.

See the respective licenses of Awesome WM and Vicious.

I would be grateful to receive any suggestions, questions and
especially advice on Lua, awesomewm configurations and what-not.
You can find me at Freenode under a nick 'icelesstea'.
